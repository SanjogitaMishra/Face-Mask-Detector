# Face-Mask-Detector
Face Mask Detector with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning.

Detect face masks in real-time video streams.

main.py: Using your webcam, this script applies face mask detection to every frame in the stream.

To see our real-time  face mask detector in action, make sure you have downloaded the source code and pre-trained face mask detector model.
Before you launch the mask detector in real- time video streams , make sure you have install all the necessary software.

 To install TensorFlow 2.0 , try the following command: 
 
 pip install tensorflow
 
 pip install opencv-contrib-python
 
 pip install scikit-image
 
 pip install pillow
 
 pip install imutils
 
 These  are image processing libraries will allow us to perform image I/O, various preprocessing techniques, as well as graphical display.
 
From there, letâ€™s install machine learning libraries and support libraries, the most notable two being scikit-learn and matplotlib:

  
 pip install scikit-learn  
 
 pip install matplotlib
 
 pip install progressbar2
 
 pip install beautifulsoup4
 
 pip install pandas
 
   
   
You can then launch the mask detector in real-time video streams using the following command:

python main.py
